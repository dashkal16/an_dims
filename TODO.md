## Glyphs
 * Nether Transference
   * Teleports target to the nether using the same logic as a nether portal (Complete with a small mageblock platform if that would put you over the lava ocean.
 * End Transference
   * Teleports target to the end spawning location
 * Overworld Transference
   * Teleports target to the overworld, accounting for dimensional coordinate conversions (to your bed / world spawn if from the end)
 * Dimensional Shift
   * Teleports target to the target of a dimensionally aware warp scroll (new item)

## Items
 * Dimensionally aware warp scroll
   * Recipes are to be per-dimension and datapack accessible
 * Spell Focus: Transferance
   * Mana discount for Blink, Transference
   * Source discount for Portal Creation

## Constructions
 * AN style portal that works interdimensionally
   * Color hints at target dimension.  Perhaps set in the same recipe as makes the warp scroll?
